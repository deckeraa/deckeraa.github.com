Once upon a time, in a land so fine,<br/>
where analysis happened all the time,<br/>
lived a happy little class family.<br/>
Yes, it was in the land of OO, where lines<br/>
and boxes and use case scenarios<br/>
frolic playfully in the street and all<br/>
the happy classes live together with<br/>
minimal coupling and high cohesion.<br/>
<br/>
Twas dusk one night at the coding class house,<br/>
where lived a family whose existence was due<br/>
to an assignment from a programming class.<br/>
Twas the RPN family of who<br/>
members were Susie Stack, sibling Quentin Queue,<br/>
RPNEval and Driver Class too.<br/>
Daddy Driver Class tucked them into bed<br/>
along with the state from their objects, he said.<br/>
Scary stories of high coupling he read,<br/>
but he assured them that all those bugs were long dead.<br/>
<br/>
Those bugs were before we had UML,<br/>
now we have OO and life is just swell.<br/>
With those words he bid them all a good night,<br/>
he bid them sweet dreams and turned off the light.<br/>
He thought to himself, as he went to his room,<br/>
Their state is encapsulated, all that<br/>
talk from functional programmers, of doom<br/>
and despair from state was lame and old hat.<br/>
He had it all taken care of, put in each class,<br/>
the lambda and OO schools had reached an impasse.<br/>
<br/>
But all through the night he had quite a fright,<br/>
unspeakable horrors passing through his mind's sight.<br/>
He dreamt of a kraken, no, just a huge squid,<br/>
that just stood and stared as he wondered what it did.<br/>
It's cavernous eyes peered deep into his soul,<br/>
This must be a prank, just a functional troll.<br/>
But there its singular figure remained,<br/>
on the UML of his soul it was firmly engrained.<br/>
Its tentacles were just lines, his face a mere shape,<br/>
But the diagram of his family it threatened to reshape.<br/>
<br/>
Rebellion against father, but just in his dream,<br/>
for RPNEval was drinking from the forbidden stream.<br/>
That ethereal stream that is called I/O,<br/>
whose state at runtime, nobody knows.<br/>
The paternal class cursed in frustration, no fear he could quell,<br/>
he thought he had had it all planned out so well.<br/>
But his model was naive, much too simple to be good,<br/>
he hadn't modeled the state of the <i>whole</i> program like he should.<br/>
But now complexity, and inter-dependency too,<br/>
clamored around his program, like the monkeys at a zoo.<br/>
<br/>
Now there is a moral to this story, something just for you,<br/>
model <i>all</i> the state in your program, or this too you will rue.<br/>
